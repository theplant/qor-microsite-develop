# QOR Microsite develop workflow

## Create microsite step: 
1. login to admin, open /admin/micro_sites
2. add new microsite
3. click `develop` button
4. start developing

## Dependencies
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 4 on your machine.
We strongly recommend to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 for faster installation speed and better disk usage

## How to develop microsite
- Download [Microsite develop environment](https://github.com/theplant/qor-microsite-develop/archive/v1.0-beta.zip) ZIP file.
- Unzip file, go to `microsite-develop` directory.
- Create a folder(e.g. named `src`) or move your microsite project folder into `microsite-develop` directory(:bulb: **Tip:** All below setups assume your microsite assets folder name is `src`, you should change it if you rename the assets folder).
- Install required Node.js modules

```$ npm install```


- Open `microsite.config.js` file to modify microsite config

  - `S3`: AWS S3 config.
  - `WatchPath`: your microsite assets path(`/Users/yourname/microsite-develop/src`).
  - `Webpack`: If you don't need webpack tool to bundle your assets. just ignore this config.
  - `PreviewUrl`: check admin microsite preview url, replace with your microsite preview url.
