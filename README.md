Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 4 on your machine.

## How to develop microsite
- Download Microsite develop environment ZIP file.
- Unzip file, go to `microsite-develop` directory.
- Create a folder(e.g. named `src`) or move your microsite project folder into `microsite-develop` directory.
- Install required Node.js modules

```$ npm install```

- Copy your all microsite assets files into `microsite-develop/src` directory.
- Open `microsite.config.js` file to modify microsite config

  - `S3` config.

  - `WatchPath` property to your real work path(`/Users/yourname/project/microsite-develop/src`).

  - `Webpack` config,(If you don't need webpack tool to bundle your assets. just ignore this config).

  - `PreviewUrl` check admin microsite preview url, copy to here.
